## How to Access the Templates
- Clone the repository to your local machine:

### Changes Made:

1. Changed the formatting of the **Contact Me** section to ensure it comes under a heading and is properly aligned.
2. Added a clear **Contact Me** heading to make it more structured.

This should align the contact information properly beneath its heading, keeping everything organized. Let me know if you need further adjustments.
